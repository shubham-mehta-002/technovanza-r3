## Question For BCA

1. Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

2. Write a menu driven program to perform the following on a matrix:
a) Check whether the matrix is an Identity matrix or not
b) Check whether the given matrix is square matrix or not
c) Addition of two matrices.

3. Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

4. The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is.

5. Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters

## Question For MCA

1. You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
  Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
  Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
  Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
  The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

3. Given an array arr of n positive integers, your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element of the array is considered a leader if it is greater than all the elements on its right side or if it is equal to the maximum element on its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.

    Input: n = 6, arr[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
    Output: 17 5 2
    Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.

4. Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union. The Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays. Return the elements in sorted order.

   Input: 
  n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
  m = 5, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
  Output: 
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  Explanation: 
  Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
